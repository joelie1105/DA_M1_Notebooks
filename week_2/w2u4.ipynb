    "# Iterating using the [for loop](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements) - Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are needed in programming to run through a group of statements multiple times. The Python programming language has\n",
    "two types of loops: the `while` loop and the `for` loop. The `for` loop is a language element that is well suited for\n",
    "processing sequences like strings (character by character) and lists (element by element). Using a `for` loop a code\n",
    "block can be executed for every element of a list or every character of a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax\n",
    "The general syntax of the `for` loop in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for sequence-variable in sequence:\n",
    "    statement_1\n",
    "    statement_2\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    statement_n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing a sequence with a `for` loop, one element of the sequence is assigned to a *sequence-variable* in each\n",
    "iteration. For example, when a `for` loop iterates over a string, one character is processed in each loop pass. What is\n",
    "done in the processing part of the loop is determined by the statements in the *loop body*. Just like `if-elif-else`,\n",
    "the loop body is specified by indenting. All statements in the loop body are then executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following graphic illustrates the execution of a `for` loop ![for_loop.png](./img/for_loop.png)"
